#always solve the forensic questions frist even before opening the read me 

#you will see the words nano and pico a lot these are text editors such as 
#note pad or vscode there just terminal based your able to use them interchangblely 

#ex:

    nano myScript.sh
    pico myScript.sh

#these will open the same fiie to create a file you can either use touch or 
#directly use the text editor command. using the text editor command will 
#automaticly put you inside of the “doc” to edit it 

#ex:

    touch example.sh
    nano example.sh

#or 

    nano example.shh

#hope fully if you are using this checklist you learned basic bash scripting 
#like i asked you to do but i expectied you to not well because your you (YES YOU REED/MARWA) 
#fortunetly i know how so i can quickly explain this for you event that i was unable to attend 
#evey time you make a scipt you have to put the .sh file indicator at the end to show that is a 
#script like this

    nano myScript.sh


#for this example we will be using the nano(pico) text editor when you open the file it will be 
#blank like this but with simple commands at the bottom



#the very first thing you do with scripts is to but #!/bin/bash like this

#!/bin/bash


#then you paste the script below after words you press control + O to save/write 
#(i will be refering to this as write) then control + X to exit the script you will 
#be back in there terminal now clear the terminal by typeing clear some of the scripts 
#can place a wall of text and can be unread able to some 


clear


#then type bash then the name of your script


bash myScript.sh


#there you’ve ran and made your first script this is one of 2 methods the 
#other one is to stright copy and paste into the terimanl this works better for 
#shorter scripts i showed you this one first becuase more of the scipts will work 
#better with it own file so it is easer to manage. 

#YOU CANNOT USE SHORT CUTS YOU MUST RIGHT CLICK 

#now you can open the read me take a photo of the athurized users and then follow the First Step doc
#now use your brain here dont be stupid if the read me says dont upgrade then only use the update 
#command and close out the upgrade pop ups fsrom here use the photo of the authorized users and follow the Check Users doc 
#now dont be an idiot take a photo of the authoized apps and solve the image make sure that the authorized apps are fully 
#up to date and if you some how mess up the image by using scripts that I HAVE NOT TESTED i will find you and murder you 
#for runing my image have a fun time :D

#and if you get to this point and cant figure out how to open the teminal its alt+control+T
